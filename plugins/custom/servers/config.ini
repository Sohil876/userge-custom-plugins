envs:
# env vars keys separated using commas.
# ex: HEROKU_API_KEY, HEROKU_APP_NAME
# if one or many env vars are missing, the plugin will not be loaded.
# special case:
#   lets say you want either GOOGLE_API or GPHOTOS_API.
#   so you can do that using "|" > GOOGLE_API | GPHOTOS_API
# ex: GOOGLE_API | GPHOTOS_API, SECRET_KEY
bins:
# same as envs.
# you should mention all the bins which are being used by this plugin.
# ex: node, ffmpeg
packages: aiohttp, bs4
# specify all the required pip packages here. separated using commas.
# ex: requests, UsergeAntiSpamApi==0.1.8, spamwatch, Pillow>=9.0.0
# the plugin will be ignored if there is a conflict.
depends:
# mention all the required plugins to use this plugin.
# plugins names separated using commas.
# lets say we are using download plugin's some shared methods, so we have to mention it here.
# hence, if the download plugin is unavailable then also this plugin will be unavailable.
# ex: download, upload
